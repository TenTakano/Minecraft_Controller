# MinecraftController

MinecraftController is a controller for Minecraft server that achieves both low cost and high spec on AWS EC2.
MinecraftController runs on a low-cost EC2 instance all the time, and provides interfaces for users to start a high-cost EC2 instance. Since the controller limits the running time of the high-cost instance, you can save the cost.
